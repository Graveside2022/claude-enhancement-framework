# Backup System Update Summary
Date: $(date -u +%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ)
User: Christian
Project: CLAUDE Improvement

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Timing Interval Updates (30 â†’ 120 minutes)

#### Project CLAUDE.md (`/Users/scarmatrix/Project/CLAUDE_improvement/CLAUDE.md`)
- âœ… Updated all occurrences of "30 minutes" to "120 minutes" for backup timing
- âœ… Updated all occurrences of "thirty minutes" to "two hours" in documentation
- âœ… Changed all `age_minutes -gt 30` to `age_minutes -gt 120`
- âœ… Changed all `age_minutes -ge 30` to `age_minutes -ge 120`
- âœ… Updated "30-minute backup due" to "120-minute backup due"
- âœ… Updated "scheduled_30min" to "scheduled_120min"
- âœ… Updated decision matrices and checkpoints

#### Global CLAUDE.md (`~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`)
- âœ… Applied identical timing updates as project file
- âœ… Ensured consistency across both configuration files

### 2. Pruning Logic Implementation

#### create_backup() Function
```bash
# PRUNING: Delete all other backups after creating new one
echo "ðŸ§¹ Pruning old backups..."
find backups -type d -name "20*_v*" ! -path "${backup_dir}" -exec rm -rf {} + 2>/dev/null || true
echo "âœ“ Kept only current backup: ${backup_dir}"
```

#### create_project_backup() Function
- âœ… Added identical pruning logic
- âœ… Added backup logging before pruning

### 3. Updated Backup Flow
1. 120 minutes elapse (previously 30)
2. Check if backup needed
3. Create new backup with versioning
4. Log the backup creation
5. **NEW**: Delete all other backups, keeping only the current one
6. Report completion

### 4. Key Function Updates

#### check_scheduled_backup()
- Checks if 120 minutes have passed since last backup
- Creates backup with reason "scheduled_120min"

#### create_backup() and create_project_backup()
- Both now include pruning logic
- Deletes all backups except the one just created
- Provides clear feedback about pruning

### 5. Documentation Updates
- All timing rule documentation updated
- Decision matrices reflect 120-minute intervals
- Continuous monitoring checklists updated
- Session end protocols reference 120-minute rules

## Testing

A test script has been created at `test_backup_system.sh` to verify:
- Backup creation functionality
- Pruning logic (only one backup remains)
- 120-minute timing threshold
- Proper function extraction and execution

## Impact

This change will:
- Reduce backup frequency from every 30 minutes to every 2 hours
- Significantly reduce disk space usage by keeping only the latest backup
- Maintain simpler backup management with single backup retention
- Continue to preserve work with 2-hour granularity

## Notes for Christian

The backup system now operates on a 2-hour cycle with automatic pruning. This means:
- You'll have less frequent but still regular backups
- Only the most recent backup is kept, saving disk space
- The system is simpler to manage with just one backup at a time
- All timing rules have been consistently updated across both CLAUDE.md files

To test the changes, run: `./test_backup_system.sh`
