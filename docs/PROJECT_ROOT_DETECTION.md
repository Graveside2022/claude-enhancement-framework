# Project Root Detection Enhancement

## Overview

The Claude system now includes enhanced project root detection capabilities that allow it to work correctly from any subdirectory within a project. This enhancement solves the previous limitation where learning files and project resources could only be accessed when working from the project root directory.

## Problem Solved

Previously, Claude's project-specific features only worked when the current working directory was the project root. This meant:
- Learning files in `./memory/` were not found from subdirectories
- Pattern searches failed when run from nested directories
- Project discovery only checked the current directory

## Solution

The enhancement adds intelligent directory traversal that searches upward through the filesystem to locate the project root based on marker files.

## Implementation

### Core Function: `find_project_root()`

This function implements a three-tier detection strategy:

1. **Primary Markers** (Highest Confidence)
   - Looks for `CLAUDE.md` file
   - Most reliable indicator of a Claude-enabled project

2. **Secondary Markers** (Medium Confidence)
   - Checks for `memory/` directory with `learning_archive.md`
   - Indicates active Claude learning system

3. **Tertiary Markers** (Lower Confidence)
   - Common project files: `package.json`, `requirements.txt`, `.git/`
   - Must also have Claude-specific files like `SESSION_CONTINUITY.md`

### Usage

The function is now integrated into:
- Project discovery scans
- Learning file loading
- Backup operations
- Pattern searches

### Example

```bash
# From any subdirectory:
cd /path/to/project/src/components/deep/nested
PROJECT_ROOT=$(find_project_root)
echo $PROJECT_ROOT  # Output: /path/to/project
```

## Benefits

1. **Work from Anywhere**: No need to navigate to project root
2. **Consistent Behavior**: Same functionality from any directory
3. **Automatic Detection**: No manual configuration required
4. **Fail-Safe**: Falls back to current directory if no root found

## Testing

Two test scripts validate the functionality:
- `test_project_detection.sh`: Tests root detection from 8 different locations
- `test_learning_file_loading.sh`: Verifies file loading works correctly

## Integration

The enhancement has been applied to:
- Local project `CLAUDE.md`
- Global `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`
- All path-dependent operations

## Performance

- Detection time: <20ms even from deeply nested directories
- Maximum search depth: 20 directories (prevents infinite loops)
- No noticeable impact on session startup

## For Developers

To use this in new functions:

```bash
# Get project root
local project_root=$(find_project_root)

# Use it for file paths
if [ -f "$project_root/memory/some_file.md" ]; then
    # File found using project root
fi
```

## Maintenance

The function is self-contained and requires no maintenance unless:
- New project markers need to be added
- Detection priority needs adjustment
- Maximum depth limit needs modification
