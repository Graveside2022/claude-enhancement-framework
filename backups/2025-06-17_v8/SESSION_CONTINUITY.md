## PERSISTENT BOOT MEMORY STORAGE - AGENT EXECUTION PREFERENCES ‚ö° - 2025-06-17T21:45:30Z

### üß† CHRISTIAN'S PERMANENT AGENT EXECUTION RULE - MANDATORY ENFORCEMENT

**AGENT_EXECUTION_RULE**: Never use sequential agents. Always use 5 agents for simple tasks, 10 agents for complex tasks. Parallel execution mandatory.

#### Persistent Memory Entry Details:
- **User**: Christian
- **Preference**: Parallel agent execution always
- **Simple Tasks**: 5 agents minimum (parallel execution)
- **Complex Tasks**: 10 agents minimum (parallel execution)
- **Sequential Agents**: NEVER use - explicitly forbidden
- **Boot Loading**: This rule loads automatically on every boot sequence
- **Override Capability**: None - this is a binding preference

#### Implementation Status:
‚úÖ **Memory Entry Created**: Persistent storage in SESSION_CONTINUITY.md  
‚úÖ **Boot Integration**: Automatically loaded on every session start  
‚úÖ **Enforcement**: Binding rule that overrides default agent configurations  
‚úÖ **Persistence**: Survives across all boot sequences and session handoffs  
‚úÖ **Auto-Loading**: This rule is automatically loaded on every session start  

#### Technical Implementation:
- **Storage Location**: SESSION_CONTINUITY.md (persistent across boots)
- **Loading Mechanism**: Automatic boot sequence integration
- **Enforcement Level**: Binding (cannot be overridden without explicit user change)
- **Scope**: All agent deployments across all tasks and contexts

### BOOT SEQUENCE INTEGRATION:
**This rule will be automatically loaded and enforced on every boot sequence, ensuring Christian's preference for parallel agent execution is always respected.**

## Current Session - 2025-06-17 21:45:30
