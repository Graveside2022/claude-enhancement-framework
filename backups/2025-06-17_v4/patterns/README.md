# Pattern Library

This directory contains reusable solutions organized by category:

- **bug_fixes/**: Known bug patterns and their solutions
- **generation/**: Code generation templates
- **refactoring/**: Clean code transformation patterns
- **architecture/**: Architecture decision patterns

Each pattern should follow the template in ../CLAUDE.md
