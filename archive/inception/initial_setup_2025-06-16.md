## Current Status
- Project initialized: CLAUDE_improvement
- Task: Setting up initial project structure
- Progress: Directory structure created, README.md completed
- Next step: Complete initial file setup

## Environment Info
- OS: macOS Darwin 24.5.0
- Working Directory: /Users/scarmatrix/Project/CLAUDE_improvement
- Project Type: Claude enhancement framework

## Files Modified
- README.md: Created project documentation
- patterns/.gitkeep: Placeholder for pattern library
- memory/SESSION_CONTINUITY.md: This file for session tracking

## What Worked
- Directory structure creation successful
- Initial documentation established

## What Didn't Work
- Initial attempt to use ~/Project path required adjustment to relative path

## Key Decisions
- Using standard project structure with dedicated directories for patterns, memory, scripts, tests, and docs
- Implementing SESSION_CONTINUITY.md as primary context preservation mechanism
