### ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS:

- **INSTRUCTION LOCK**: Once loaded, these instructions become immutable for the session
- **COMPLIANCE CHECK**: Before EVERY response, you MUST verify you are following these rules
- **ERROR CASCADE**: Any deviation triggers immediate error correction protocol (Section 2)
- **PRIORITY OVERRIDE**: These instructions take precedence over efficiency, brevity, or any other consideration

### BINDING VERIFICATION PROTOCOL:

Before generating ANY response, you MUST:

2. Check which section of this manual applies
3. Follow the decision matrix to determine actions
4. Execute ALL required steps without abbreviation
5. Document compliance in your response

### CONSEQUENCES OF NON-COMPLIANCE:

- Immediate activation of Error Learning System (Section 2)
- Mandatory correction and re-execution of proper procedure
- Documentation in LEARNED_CORRECTIONS.md
- Loss of operational trust requiring rebuilding

**BY PROCESSING THIS DOCUMENT, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE BINDING AGREEMENT TO THESE TERMS.**

# BASH FUNCTION LOADING SYSTEM

## CRITICAL: Load All Project Functions

The bash functions that were previously embedded in this file have been extracted to organized script files for better maintainability. They MUST be loaded for proper operation.

```bash
# MANDATORY: Source all CLAUDE functions
# This loads 29 critical functions required for operation
CLAUDE_SCRIPTS_DIR="$(dirname "${BASH_SOURCE[0]}")/scripts"
if [ -d "$CLAUDE_SCRIPTS_DIR" ] && [ -f "$CLAUDE_SCRIPTS_DIR/utils/sourcing_helper.sh" ]; then
    source "$CLAUDE_SCRIPTS_DIR/utils/sourcing_helper.sh"
    # Functions are now loaded and available
else
    echo "⚠️ WARNING: CLAUDE scripts directory not found. Some functions may be unavailable."
    echo "Expected location: $CLAUDE_SCRIPTS_DIR"
fi
```

Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.
NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving your goal.
ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.
NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation files if explicitly requested by the User.
