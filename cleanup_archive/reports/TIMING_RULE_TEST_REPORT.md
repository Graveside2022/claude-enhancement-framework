## Test Summary

Successfully tested the 120-minute timing rule enforcement without loading full procedures.

## Test Results

### 1. Detection Test ✅
- Created TODO.md with 3-hour old timestamp
- Created backup marker with 3-hour old timestamp
- Timing check correctly detected both violations:
  - TODO.md: 180 minutes old (VIOLATION - limit 120)
  - Backup: 180 minutes old (VIOLATION - limit 120)

### 2. Enforcement Test ✅
- Timing enforcement function successfully:
  - Updated TODO.md with timing rule violation note
  - Created new backup (2025-06-17_v3)
  - Updated backup marker timestamp
  - Logged enforcement actions

### 3. Verification Test ✅
- After enforcement, timing check showed:
  - TODO.md: 0 minutes old (COMPLIANT)
  - Backup: 0 minutes ago (COMPLIANT)
  - All rules satisfied

## Key Findings

1. **Lightweight Detection**: The timing checks work independently without loading full CLAUDE.md procedures
2. **Automatic Enforcement**: Rules can trigger automatic updates when violations detected
3. **Proper Logging**: All enforcement actions are logged with timestamps
4. **Backup Versioning**: System correctly increments backup versions (v1, v2, v3)

## Timing Rule Behavior

The 120-minute rules enforce as follows:

### TODO.md Rule
- Checks file modification time
- If > 120 minutes: Triggers immediate update
- Appends timing rule update section
- Resets modification timestamp

### Backup Rule  
- Checks .last_scheduled_backup marker
- If ≥ 120 minutes: Creates new backup
- Uses versioned directory structure
- Updates marker file
- Logs action to backup_log.txt

## Conclusion

✅ **120-minute timing rules enforce correctly**
- Detection works without full procedure load
- Enforcement executes required actions
- System maintains compliance automatically
- All timing violations are corrected immediately

The timing rule system is fully functional and can operate as a lightweight enforcement mechanism independent of the full CLAUDE.md procedure loading.
