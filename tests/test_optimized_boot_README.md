# Optimized Boot Sequence Test

## Purpose
This test validates the new optimized boot sequence for CLAUDE that prioritizes reading SESSION_CONTINUITY.md first and only performs full initialization when necessary.

## What It Tests

1. **SESSION_CONTINUITY.md Read First** - Verifies that the session continuity file is the first thing read during boot
2. **Conditional Initialization** - Ensures full init only happens when needed (new session, missing data, etc.)
3. **120-Minute Age Detection** - Validates that the 120-minute timing rules still trigger appropriately
4. **Boot Time Improvement** - Measures the performance gain from the optimization
5. **No TODO Creation** - Confirms that the boot process itself doesn't create unnecessary TODOs
6. **Full Integration** - Tests the complete optimized boot sequence end-to-end

## Usage

```bash
# Run the test
./tests/test_optimized_boot.sh

# View detailed output
./tests/test_optimized_boot.sh | tee test_results.log
```

## Expected Results

All tests should pass with output like:
```
✓ PASS: SESSION_CONTINUITY.md read first
✓ PASS: Conditional init - Skip when recent
✓ PASS: Conditional init - Full boot when new
✓ PASS: 120-minute age detection - File age check
✓ PASS: 120-minute trigger - Activation check
✓ PASS: Boot time improvement - >50% faster
✓ PASS: No TODOs created during boot
✓ PASS: Full optimized boot sequence

✓ ALL TESTS PASSED!
```

## Implementation Notes

The test creates temporary fixtures and restores original files after testing. It simulates various boot scenarios to ensure the optimization works correctly in all cases.

Key optimizations validated:
- Minimal boot for existing sessions (just read SESSION_CONTINUITY.md)
- Full boot only when truly needed
- Lazy loading of patterns and learning files
- Deferred timing checks

## Boot Time Improvements

Expected improvements:
- Old boot: 850-1550ms (loads everything)
- New boot: 50-200ms (minimal read)
- Improvement: 75-90% faster for most operations
